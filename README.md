## Building
Apache Maven is the build tool of choice.  Simply issue `mvn install package` to install dependencies and build the jar.  
Use `mvn clean install compile verify test package site` to clean up existing targets, install dependencies, verify, run unit tests, build a jar, and create the documentation and reports.

## Running
Issue a `java -jar target/helloworld-<VERSION>-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` to run the target directly.

## Docker Environment
1. Download and install Docker [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. Build the mscs502 image by running `docker build -t mscs502 .` in a terminal
3. Then run the container based on the mscs502 image with `docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/helloworld mscs502` on Linux or an absolute path in Windows like `docker run -it --rm -v /c/Users/MICHAELGILDEIN/frilly-chicken-bucket:/helloworld mscs502`
4. Use VSCode or your IDE of choice to edit your code locally.  HINT: Run `code .` from the terminal when in the folder to easily open it
5. Build and run the code as you would locally from the Docker container bash prompt

## Tests
[JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) is used as the Test Framework. To execute unit tests run `mvn test`.  
To skip tests, add `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` as an argument to your Maven command.
